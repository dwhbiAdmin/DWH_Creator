Artifact Generator - Step 4
===========================

Handles final artifact creation and file generation.
Implements Tab C functionality from the specification.

Key responsibilities:
- Coordinating template processing with metadata
- Generating DDL and ETL artifacts
- Organizing output files by stage and type
- File system operations for artifact storage
