## 🔧 **Current Test Analysis**

### ✅ **What's Working Well (30 passing tests)**
- **Basic object initialization** across all classes
- **Excel read/write operations** with real workbooks
- **AI feature availability checks** and basic functionality
- **Error handling** for missing files and edge cases
- **Integration workflows** when components work together

### ⚠️ **Areas Needing Attention (34 failing tests)**

#### **API Mocking Issues**
- Real OpenAI API calls being made during tests (should be mocked)
- Need better test isolation from external dependencies
- API key management in test environment

#### **ConfigManager Structure Mismatches**
- Tests expect 'columns' key but actual config uses 'headers'
- Default data structure differs from test expectations
- Need to align tests with actual implementation

#### **Missing Methods**
- ExcelUtils missing `create_workbook` method (referenced in 5 failed tests)
- Some AI workbench methods not fully implemented as expected

#### **Test Environment Setup**  
- Path resolution issues in some tests
- Fixture dependencies not properly isolated
- Need better test data management
